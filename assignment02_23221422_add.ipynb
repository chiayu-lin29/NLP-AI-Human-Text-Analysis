This approach avoids repeatedly loading the BERT model and regenerating embeddings, which significantly reduces computational cost and prevents unnecessary delays.\n",

As the workflow became more complex, I refactored the structure so that the embedder is defined only once at the start.

    "<mark>Analysis</mark> Comparison between Assignment 1 and 2\n",
    "\n",
    "[Comparison Between TF-IDF Baseline and Embedding-Based Models]\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Performance Summary\n",
    "The TF-IDF + Logistic Regression baseline from Assignment 01 remains highly competitive:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model           | Accuracy  | Weighted F1 |\n",
    "| --------------- | --------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| **TF-IDF + LR** | **0.900** | **0.894**   |\n",
    "| **BERT + LR**   | **0.892** | **0.890**   |\n",
    "| BERT + XGB      | 0.872     | 0.870       |\n",
    "| Word2Vec + XGB  | 0.864     | 0.860       |\n",
    "| Word2Vec + LR   | 0.856     | 0.860       |\n",
    "| BERT + RF       | 0.836     | 0.830       |\n",
    "\n",
    "Only BERT + LR approaches the baseline, while most embedding-based pipelines perform notably worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The reason why TF-IDF Performs Exceptionally Well\n",
    "- AI-generated abstracts contain distinctive lexical and frequency patterns\n",
    "- These differences are captured directly in TF-IDF’s sparse vector space.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression performs well with high-dimensional sparse inputs, offering strong separation between the two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the TF-IDF baseline benefits from clear lexical signals inherent in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Limitations of Embedding-Based Representations\n",
    "Embedding-based methods do not always surpass TF-IDF because:\n",
    "- Word2Vec averages vectors, losing syntactic structure and sentence-level characteristics.\n",
    "- BERT embeddings are dense and highly non-linear; tree-based models (RF/XGB) often underperform with such representations.\n",
    "- Embeddings may smooth over subtle token-frequency cues that TF-IDF captures precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Conclusion\n",
    "- If computational efficiency is essential\n",
    "    - TF-IDF + LR remains an excellent, lightweight baseline with near–state-of-the-art performance.\n",
    "- If long-term robustness and semantic flexibility are prioritized:\n",
    "    - BERT + LR is the preferred model, offering the best balance of accuracy, generalization, and interpretability."
