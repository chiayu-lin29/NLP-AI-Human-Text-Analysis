NLP Analysis: Human vs. AI Text Differentiation
This project focuses on the linguistic analysis of text generated by humans and Artificial Intelligence. The primary objective is to investigate the stylistic differences between these two sources and to evaluate the reliability of current AI detection tools.

📌 Project Overview
The research explores how Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts apply to the practical challenge of distinguishing machine-generated content from human writing.

Textual Comparison: Analyzing how AI-generated responses differ from human writing in terms of tone, structure, and length.

Detection Benchmarking: Testing and evaluating various AI writing detectors to determine their accuracy and limitations.

Prompt Impact Analysis: Investigating how different instructions (prompts) change the "detectability" of AI-generated text.

📂 Repository Structure
1. Comparative Text Analysis
