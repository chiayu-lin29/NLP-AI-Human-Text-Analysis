    "### Model Design Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure a fair and comprehensive evaluation of text representation and classification strategies,\n",
    "this study compares two distinct vectorization methods (Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF)\n",
    "alongside three classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Count Vectorization vs. TF-IDF**  \n",
    "  These methods capture lexical features at different levels of abstraction.  \n",
    "  Count Vectorization reflects raw word frequencies, suitable for simple lexical statistics analysis, while TF-IDF normalizes high-frequency words and highlights information-rich terms, thereby more effectively modeling linguistic salience in long-form texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testing of Three Classifiers**  \n",
    "  - *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*: A non-parametric, instance-based model serving as a baseline purely dependent on lexical distance.  \n",
    "  - *Naive Bayes (NB)*: A probabilistic model assuming lexical independence, suitable for high-dimensional sparse text data. \n",
    "  - *Logistic Regression (LR)*: A linear discriminant model with L2 regularization,\n",
    "    balancing interpretability, scalability, and generalization capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing these combinations, the most effective feature-model pairing scheme can be identified\n",
    "to distinguish AI-generated text from human-written text while minimizing bias arising from single modeling assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression** combination achieved the highest validation performance,\n",
    "demonstrating that TF-IDF's weighting of lexical importance, combined with a regularized linear boundary,\n",
    "provides optimal generalization capabilities for this language classification task."
